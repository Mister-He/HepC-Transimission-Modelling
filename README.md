# README for Hep-C infection among prisoners

## Summary of the Manuscript

The manuscript provides a detailed analysis of the infection trends among different populations. Key points include:

- **Modeling Approach:** We used a combination of compartmental and stochastic models to simulate infection dynamics.
- **Population Groups:** Analysis covered current PWID, prisoners, and former PWID, both individually and in combined scenarios.
- **Intervention Scenarios:** Various intervention strategies were modeled, showing the impact of different annual reduction rates on infection outcomes.
- **Results Interpretation:** The results demonstrate significant reductions in infections with increased intervention efforts, highlighting the importance of targeted strategies for different groups.
- **Policy Implications:** The findings suggest that comprehensive, combined interventions are the most effective in reducing overall infection rates.
