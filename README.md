# Hepatitis C transmission and progression among people who have injected drugs in Singapore: Modelling treatment for eradication

## Summary

The study provides a detailed analysis of the infection trends among different populations. Key points include:

- **Modeling Approach:** We used a combination of compartmental and stochastic models to simulate infection dynamics.
- **Population Groups:** Analysis covered current PWID, prisoners, and former PWID, both individually and in combined scenarios.
- **Intervention Scenarios:** Various intervention strategies were modeled, showing the impact of different annual reduction rates on infection outcomes.
- **Results Interpretation:** The results demonstrate significant reductions in infections with increased intervention efforts, highlighting the importance of targeted strategies for different groups.
- **Policy Implications:** The findings suggest that comprehensive, combined interventions are the most effective in reducing overall infection rates.

## Example usage

If you want to reproduce all outputs from the model, can directly run `main.R` in the project folder with any integrated development environment which can run R. Or you directly run the program in command line using:

```bash
nohup Rscript main.R >output.log 2>&1 &
```

It requires R version to be at least `4.5.1`. Please update R to latest version if you haven't done so.
